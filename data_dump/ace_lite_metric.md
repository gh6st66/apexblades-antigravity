# ACE Lite: The 5-Point Team Checklist

**ACE Lite** (Apex Composition Evaluator) is a simplified system to quickly rate your squad without complex math. Instead of rating every skill 1-5, you just answer **5 YES/NO Questions**.

## The Formula
Every "YES" is worth **20 Points**.
**Target Score:** 80+ for Ranked, 60+ for Pubs/Wild Card.

---

## 1. VISION? (20 pts)
**Can you see enemies through walls, smoke, or chaotic visual clutter?**
*   **YES** if you have: Bloodhound, Seer, Crypto, Vantage (Ult), Fuse (Ult), or Digital Threats.
*   **Why?** In modern Apex, if you can't see them, you can't hit them.

## 2. ROTATION? (20 pts)
**Can you move the ENTIRE team safely across open ground?**
*   **YES** if you have: Valkyrie (Ult), Pathfinder (Zipline), Wraith (Portal), Octane (Pad), Ash (Portal), Horizon (Lift - situational), or Alter (Void Passage).
*   **Why?** Getting stuck in a choke point is the #1 cause of death.

## 3. RESET? (20 pts)
**If a teammate gets cracked or knocked, can you stop the enemy push?**
*   **YES** if you have: Gibraltar (Bubble), Newcastle (Shield/Revive), Bangalore (Smoke), Caustic (Gas), Wattson (Fences), Rampart (Walls), or Lifeline (Res).
*   **Why?** You *will* take damage. You need a way to heal without dying.

## 4. INITIATION? (20 pts)
**Can you start a fight with a massive advantage (Damage or Crowd Control)?**
*   **YES** if you have: Crypto (EMP), Horizon (Black Hole), Fuse (Clusters/Ult), Maggie (Ball), Ballistic (Whistler/Ult), Revenant (Pounce), or Ash (Snare).
*   **Why?** Fair fights are for losers. You want to crack them *before* you push.

## 5. COMFORT? (20 pts)
**Does everyone on the team actually main their selected Legend?**
*   **YES** if: You are playing your comfort picks.
*   **NO** if: Someone picked a "Meta" legend they have never played before just because a tier list said so.
*   **Why?** A master Mirage is better than a first-time Bangalore.

## 👑 The Grades

| Score | Grade | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **100** | **S-Tier** | **God Squad.** You have it all. No excuses. |
| **80** | **A-Tier** | **Great.** You are missing one piece (usually Rotation or Vision), but you can win by playing smart. |
| **60** | **B-Tier** | **Viable.** You have significant gaps. You must play around your weakness (e.g., if no Rotation, rotate early!). |
| **40** | **C-Tier** | **Struggle Bus.** You are relying on pure gunskill. Good luck. |
| **0-20** | **F-Tier** | **Trolling.** Why are you doing this? |

## 🃏 Wild Card Modifiers
*If playing Wild Card mode, add these bonus rules:*
*   **"The Triple Stack" (+10 pts):** Are you running 3 of the same Legend? (Confusion factor + Ability spam).
*   **"Kill Squad" rule:** "Rotation" matters less. If you have 3 "Initiation" legends, give yourself a free +20.
