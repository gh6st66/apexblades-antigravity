## Strategic Playstyle

### **Core Philosophy**
> "The best offense is an electrified defense"

Wattson forces enemies to come to you on your terms. Success requires:
1. **Early rotation** to claim strong positions first
2. **Proactive fencing** - always be deploying
3. **Ultimate Accelerant management** - carry 1-2 at all times
4. **Patience** - let enemies push into your setup

### **Game Phase Strategy**

**Early Game:**
- Rotate early to strong positions
- Minimal fence usage (save for mid-game)
- Prioritize loot and Ultimate Accelerants

**Mid Game:**
- Establish defensive positions in buildings or ring edge
- Heavy fence deployment - all entry points covered
- Deploy pylon when expecting fights

**End Game (Wattson's Domain):**
- First team into final ring = massive advantage
- Maximum fence density (all 12 nodes active)
- Pylon always up for grenade defense
- Force enemies to push through your setup

## Team Synergies

### **S-Tier Synergies (Rating 5)**
- **Caustic** - "Deep Anchor" - Ultimate defensive duo
- **Gibraltar** - "Defensive Wall" - Dome + Pylon = invincible
- **Rampart** - "Fortified Defense" - Amped walls + fences
- **Newcastle** - "The Fortress" - Castle Wall + Pylon in open ground

### **A-Tier Synergies (Rating 4)**
- **Catalyst** - Entry denial through reinforced doors + fences
- **Pathfinder** - Zipline to high ground for dominant holds
- **Valkyrie** - Sky rotation for early positioning

### **B-Tier Synergies (Rating 3)**
- **Bangalore** - Smoke cover for vulnerable setups

### **Counters (Anti-Synergies)**
- **Crypto** (Rating 1) - EMP destroys all fences/pylon instantly
- **Fuse** (Rating 2) - Grenade spam (but pylon negates if active)
- **Mad Maggie** (Rating 2) - Riot Drill bypasses fences through walls
- **Horizon** (Rating 2) - Gravity Lift bypasses ground fences

---

## Positioning

### **Ideal Terrain**
- Multi-story buildings with limited entry points
- High ground with natural cover
- Ring edge positions (reduces attack angles)
- Tight final circles (fences maximize coverage)

### **Avoid**
- Wide open areas with no cover
- Low ground in open fields
- Areas with excessive vertical vulnerability

### **Rotation Timing**
- **Early/Mid Game:** Rotate early (before ring closes)
- **Late Game:** Very early - first team into final zone wins

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Mistake | Consequence | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Static play in dynamic lobbies | Caught rotating late | Practice hybrid quick-fence setups |
| Wandering alone | Easy target, low mobility | Stay near team always |
| Obvious fence placement | Fences destroyed instantly | Hide nodes behind cover |
| Holding ultimate too long | Die without using it | Deploy pylon proactively |
| Over-fortifying one entrance | Flanked from other angles | Spread fences 360 degrees |
| Panicking when breached | Abandon strong position | Trust setup - slowed enemies are vulnerable |
| Poor accelerant management | Limited pylon uptime | Always carry 1-2 accelerants |

---

## Loadout Recommendations

### **Primary Weapons**
- R-301 Carbine (easy recoil, consistent)
- Flatline (strong damage for holding angles)
- Volt SMG (hipfire for close defense)

### **Secondary Weapons**
- EVA-8 / Peacekeeper (building defense)
- Any close-range SMG

### **Philosophy**
One mid-range + one close-range for building holds. Grenades have low value (pylon negates enemy nades anyway).

---

## Mental Rules for Mastery

1. **Early rotation wins games** - be first to final ring
2. **Always be fencing** - even during active fights
3. **Trust your setup** - breached enemies are vulnerable
4. **Hide your nodes** - invisible fences are effective fences
5. **360-degree defense** - never overstack one door
6. **Information is power** - communicate fence triggers
7. **Never wander alone** - isolated Wattson is dead Wattson
8. **End-game is your domain** - dominate through preparation
9. **Shield sustain wins wars** - position near pylon
10. **Buildings are your kingdom** - interior defense excellence

- Setup wins games more than kills

### **Casual/Pubs**
