# WATTSON — RANKED CHEAT CARD (S27 Amped)

## Legend
- **Name:** Wattson
- **Role Type:** Controller
- **Primary Win Condition:** Zone Control + Placement

---

## ROLE
- **Responsible for:** Static defense, grenade interception, shield economy, information gathering via fences
- **Lead when:** Setting up end-game position, identifying defensible buildings
- **Follow when:** Rotation (mobility legends lead), aggressive pushes
- **Disengage when:** Setup is breached and Pylon is down; rotate to next layer

---

## POSITIONING
- **Preferred terrain:** Indoors, choke points, height, ring edge
- **Fight distance:** Close-mid
- **Commit vs hold:** Hold position - force enemies to push YOU. Commit only to punish fence breaches.

---

## CORE ABILITY USAGE

### Passive — Spark of Genius
- **Leverage when:** Carrying Ultimate Accelerants (100% charge), passive shield regen between fights
- **Do NOT rely on:** Passive regen during active combat (too slow)

### Tactical — Perimeter Security
- **Primary use:** Deny pushes, info on fence breaks
- **Timing:** Pre-emptive (set up before fights)
- **Key note:** 15 dmg + slow; 30s CD/node; hide nodes behind cover; triangulate doors

### Ultimate — Interception Pylon
- **Best use cases:** Zone denial, anti-nade, sustain (shield regen)
- **Do NOT use when:** Rotating globally (unless emergency cover needed)
- **Abort if:** Pylon destroyed - fall back immediately
- **Cooldown:** 180s

---

## FIGHT FLOW
1. **Start:** Secure perimeter with hidden fences → Deploy Pylon if engagement imminent
2. **Mid-fight:** Play near Pylon for shields, repair fences, punish stunned enemies
3. **Exit/Reset:** Retreat through pre-fenced path → Pop Ult Accel immediately

---

## ROTATIONS
- **Early game:** Rotate early to center zone or strong edge; loot Ult Accels
- **Mid game:** Claim God Spot early; fortify before teams arrive
- **Late game:** Total lockdown of final ring; play off Pylon sustainability
- **Bad rotation:** Late rotation into open ground without Pylon

---

## WEAPONS
- **Primary:** R-301 / Flatline / Nemesis — mid-range consistency from fortified positions
- **Secondary:** Volt / ROC / PK — close-range shredding for fence-stunned enemies
- **Avoid:** Sniper-only (too passive), Shotgun-only (lack of range)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES
1. Fencing in open sightlines (nodes destroyed instantly)
2. Holding Ultimate too long (die with full charge)
3. Wandering alone (no escape)
4. Over-fortifying one door while ignoring flanks

---

## MENTAL RULE

> **"The best offense is an electrified defense. Force them to play your game."**

## MAP OVERRIDES

### World's Edge
- **POI focus:** Fragment (Construction/Streamer)

- **Ult timing:** Deploy on roof or protected corner during multi-party fights
- **Danger zones:** Open fields between fragments

### Storm Point
- **POI focus:** Command Center, Checkpoint
- **Height rules:** Hold gravity cannon landing spots
- **Ult timing:** Essential for open-area rotations vs Bangalore/Gibby
- **Danger zones:** Cascade Falls (too open)

### Olympus
- **POI focus:** Hammond Labs, Estates, Gardens
- **Height rules:** Indoor choke dominance; rooftop Pylon placement
- **Ult timing:** Deploy early in Hammond Labs fights
