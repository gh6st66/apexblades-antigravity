# HORIZON — RANKED CHEAT CARD (S27 Amped)

## Legend
- **Name:** Horizon
- **Role Type:** Flex / Entry
- **Primary Win Condition:** KP Conversion + Height Control

---

## ROLE
- **Responsible for:** Creating angles, vertical pressure, enabling team wipes with Black Hole
- **Lead when:** Taking vertical fights, initiating with ult combos
- **Follow when:** Team has better entry (Revenant, Wraith) for horizontal pushes
- **Disengage when:** Grav Lift on CD + no ult + low ground

---

## POSITIONING
- **Preferred terrain:** Vertical POIs (buildings, natural height), anywhere with lift-able cover
- **Fight distance:** Close-mid (lift peeks, ult combos)
- **Commit vs hold:** Commit when ult is live and team can follow; hold if lift is down

---

## CORE ABILITY USAGE

### Passive — Spacewalk
- **Leverage when:** Post-lift repositions, dropping from height, aggressive air strafes
- **Do NOT rely on:** Tanking shots in the air (you're not a tank, you're a target)

### Tactical — Gravity Lift
- **Primary use:** Initiate (take angle) + escape (vertical disengage)
- **Timing:** Early or mid-fight (22s effective CD allows aggressive use)
- **Key note:** Lift speed 375 (from 300), 1.5s hover at top; Newt Scoot upgrade = glide after exit

### Ultimate — Black Hole
- **Best use cases:** Wipe (nade combos), zone (area denial), initiate (force repositions)
- **Do NOT use when:** Team isn't ready to capitalize, or enemy has easy break angle
- **Abort if:** Black Hole placed in crossfire with no follow-up damage
- **Cooldown:** 180s (down from 210), 225 HP device

---

## FIGHT FLOW
1. **Start:** Lift for height, spot enemies, call angles
2. **Mid-fight:** Black Hole → nade stack OR lift-flick peeks for quick damage
3. **Exit/Reset:** Lift to high ground, Spacewalk soft-landing to cover

---

## ROTATIONS
- **Early game:** Aggressive vertical scouting; use lift to check POIs
- **Mid game:** Save ult for multi-squad fights or third-party opportunities
- **Late game:** Black Hole for final ring denial; lift for escape when trapped
- **Bad rotation:** Walking flat terrain with lift on CD and no ult

---

## WEAPONS
- **Primary:** Alternator / R-99 — fast TTK for lift peeks, good hipfire
- **Secondary:** Bocek / G7 Scout — capitalize on height advantage from lift
- **Avoid:** LMGs (too slow for Horizon's hit-and-move style), Snipers (commit to angles too long)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES
1. Wasting Black Hole without team follow-up
2. Staying in lift too long and getting beamed
3. Using lift aggressively with no escape plan
4. Placing Black Hole where it's easily shot (225 HP, still breakable)

---

## MENTAL RULE

> **"Lift is your escape first, angle second. Black Hole only when team can capitalize."**

---

## MAP OVERRIDES

### Olympus (S27)
- **POI focus:** Hammond Labs (vertical interior), Gardens (natural height), Estates (rooftop control)
- **Height rules:** Dominant on any building; leverage lift for rooftop plays
- **Ult timing:** Black Hole in Hammond chokes, Estates courtyard, Gardens tunnels
- **Danger zones:** Turbine (no vertical cover), Solar Array (too open for lift plays)

### Broken Moon
- **POI focus:** Terraformer (multiple levels), Promenades (interior height)
- **Height rules:** Lift onto container stacks, Terraformer catwalks
- **Ult timing:** Stasis Net transitions, Breaker Wharf pushes
- **Danger zones:** The Divide (sniper lanes punish lift exposure)
