# RAMPART — RANKED CHEAT CARD (S27 Amped)

## Legend
- **Name:** Rampart
- **Role Type:** Anchor
- **Primary Win Condition:** Zone Control + Placement

---

## ROLE
- **Responsible for:** Holding space, denying pushes, enabling teammate aggression via speed boost
- **Lead when:** Setting up defensive positions, choosing where to anchor
- **Follow when:** Team wants to push aggressively (walls take time to deploy)
- **Disengage when:** Walls broken + no cover nearby, or ring forces movement

---

## POSITIONING
- **Preferred terrain:** Chokes, doorways, corners with head-glitch potential
- **Fight distance:** Mid (amped poke) + close (Sheila cleanup)
- **Commit vs hold:** Hold until wall charge is banked; commit only with speed boost active

---

## CORE ABILITY USAGE

### Passive — Battle Modder
- **Leverage when:** Any LMG fight (reload + mag bonuses), late game (800 HP walls at max Evo)
- **Do NOT rely on:** Early game wall durability (starts weak, scales with Evo)

### Tactical — Amped Cover
- **Primary use:** Zone denial + damage banking for speed boost
- **Timing:** Pre-emptive (set up before fights) or mid-fight (quick cover drops)
- **Key note:** Roof added in S27; damage through shield charges 100%, damage TO wall charges 25%; teammates can vault for sprint boost (up to 15s)

### Ultimate — Mobile Minigun "Sheila"
- **Best use cases:** Wipe (mounted suppression), zone (lane lockdown)
- **Do NOT use when:** Multiple angles exposed, or team is rotating
- **Abort if:** Flanked OR wall destroyed while mounted
- **Cooldown:** TBD (use sparingly in early/mid game)

---

## FIGHT FLOW
1. **Start:** Place walls at choke/angle, poke through amped shield to build charge
2. **Mid-fight:** Let damage bank, call out when speed boost is ready
3. **Exit/Reset:** Teammates vault for speed boost → sprint to next position

---

## ROTATIONS
- **Early game:** Identify anchor spots in zone; place walls preemptively
- **Mid game:** Bank wall charge during poke, use speed boost for ring transitions
- **Late game:** Walls are strongest (800 HP) — hold final positions aggressively
- **Bad rotation:** Walking in the open with no walls placed ahead

---

## WEAPONS
- **Primary:** Rampage / Spitfire — Battle Modder synergy (bigger mags, faster reloads)
- **Secondary:** Peacekeeper / Alternator — close-range cleanup when walls break
- **Avoid:** Snipers (you should be the anchor, not the poke), Shotgun-only (need sustained fire for wall charging)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES
1. Placing walls mid-fight instead of before engagement
2. Not communicating speed boost availability to teammates
3. Mounting Sheila with flanks uncovered
4. Abandoning walls before damage is banked

---

## MENTAL RULE

> **"Walls first, fight second. Your job is creating space teammates can exploit."**
