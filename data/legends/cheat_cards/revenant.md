# REVENANT — RANKED CHEAT CARD (S27 Amped)

## Legend
- **Name:** Revenant
- **Role Type:** Entry
- **Primary Win Condition:** KP Conversion (fast knocks)

---

## ROLE
- **Responsible for:** Opening fights, diving isolated targets, creating chaos
- **Lead when:** Dive opportunities are clear, enemy is separated
- **Follow when:** Team has better info/setup (Valk missiles, Crypto EMP, Seer ult)
- **Disengage when:** Pounce is down + team not with you + enemy squad is full

---

## POSITIONING
- **Preferred terrain:** High ground for dive angles, walls/structures for climbing
- **Fight distance:** Close (dive → kill → out)
- **Commit vs hold:** Commit only on isolated targets; hold if they're grouped

---

## CORE ABILITY USAGE

### Passive — Assassin / Stalker
- **Leverage when:** Flanking via unlimited climbing, silent crouch approaches
- **Do NOT rely on:** Out-climbing gunfire (you're still hittable on walls)

### Tactical — Shadow Pounce
- **Primary use:** Initiate (close distance) OR escape (retreat to height)
- **Timing:** Early (dive first) or reactionary (escape if caught)
- **Key note:** S27 nerfed max velocity — still strong close-mid, weaker at extreme range

### Ultimate — Forged Shadows (if applicable) / Death Totem (legacy)
- **Best use cases:** Initiate (protected push), reset (totem return)
- **Do NOT use when:** Enemy has clear totem snipe angle, or team is split
- **Abort if:** Totem is spotted before push completes
- **Cooldown:** TBD (varies by kit version)

---

## FIGHT FLOW
1. **Start:** Climb for angle → Shadow Pounce onto isolated target
2. **Mid-fight:** Immediate weapon dump, confirm knock fast
3. **Exit/Reset:** Pounce back to team OR use ult safety (if totem)

---

## ROTATIONS
- **Early game:** Aggressive POI clearing; pounce through buildings to check corners
- **Mid game:** Look for third-party dive opportunities; let team poke, you finish
- **Late game:** More conservative — dive only when knock is guaranteed
- **Bad rotation:** Pouncing into a 3-stack without team backup

---

## WEAPONS
- **Primary:** Prowler PDW (burst mode) — S27 hold-to-burst shreds at pounce range
- **Secondary:** Alternator / Peacekeeper — fast kill confirmation post-dive
- **Avoid:** Snipers (you are the dive, not the poke), LMGs (too slow to capitalize on pounce)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES
1. Pouncing into full squads instead of isolated players
2. Using pounce for generic rotations (save for fights)
3. Overcommitting when pounce is on cooldown
4. Forgetting you're squishy without ult protection

---

## MENTAL RULE

> **"Pounce is for isolated kills, not team fights. In, kill, out."**

---

## MAP OVERRIDES
