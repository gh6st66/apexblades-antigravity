# VALKYRIE — RANKED CHEAT CARD (S27 Amped)

## Legend
- **Name:** Valkyrie
- **Role Type:** Macro / Info
- **Primary Win Condition:** Rotations + Placement

---

## ROLE
- **Responsible for:** Team rotations, ring reads, third-party escapes
- **Lead when:** Rotating to zone, calling macro plays, escaping bad fights
- **Follow when:** Taking close-range fights, breaching buildings
- **Disengage when:** No ult + 2+ squads nearby, or ring is far and you're low

---

## POSITIONING
- **Preferred terrain:** Height (roof tops, cliffs, elevated POIs)
- **Fight distance:** Mid-long (poke → rotate)
- **Commit vs hold:** Hold height until team commits; only dive if knock confirmed

---

## CORE ABILITY USAGE

### Passive — VTOL Jets
- **Leverage when:** Short repositions, vertical peeks, dodging grenades
- **Do NOT rely on:** Extended combat flights (6s fuel, no mid-air refuel)

### Tactical — Missile Swarm
- **Primary use:** Info (reveals on hit) + deny movement passives
- **Timing:** Pre-emptive (scan third-party fights) or mid-fight (suppress pushers)
- **Key note:** No self-damage; 25s CD; 125m range; disables Mantle Boost on hit

### Ultimate — Skyward Dive
- **Best use cases:** Rotate, reset, escape third-parties
- **Do NOT use when:** Ring is close + full team is alive + enemies not pushing
- **Abort if:** Sniper locks on during spin-up OR enemy team hard pushes before launch
- **Cooldown:** 150s (30s penalty if hit during launch)

---

## FIGHT FLOW
1. **Start:** Take height, poke with marksman, scan with missiles
2. **Mid-fight:** Jets to reposition, short burns for off-angles
3. **Exit/Reset:** Skyward Dive if losing OR third-party incoming; rotate to high ground

---

## ROTATIONS
- **Early game:** Land edge, loot fast, scout ring with jets
- **Mid game:** Use ult proactively for ring positioning (before forced)
- **Late game:** Hold ult for emergency escape or final ring rotation
- **Bad rotation:** Walking through open terrain with ult available

---

## WEAPONS
- **Primary:** Alternator SMG (Double Tap) — S27 buffed, fast TTK, jet-peeking friendly
- **Secondary:** Bocek / G7 Scout — punish from jet angles, no bullet drop issues
- **Avoid:** Shotguns (jets make close-range awkward), Snipers (Valk shouldn't hard scope)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES
1. Using ult to push instead of escape/rotate
2. Jet-peeking with low fuel and getting beamed
3. Missiles for damage instead of info/suppression
4. Landing in the open after Skyward Dive

---

## MENTAL RULE

> **"Ult is for leaving, not arriving. Hold height, read zone, extract your team."**

---

## MAP OVERRIDES

### Olympus (S27)
- **Height rules:** Prioritize Hammond Labs, Estates rooftops, Phase Runner hill
- **Ult timing:** Save for ring 3+ transitions; too many indoor POIs early
- **Danger zones:** Turbine (too open), Energy Depot (sniper magnets)

### Broken Moon
- **Height rules:** Terraformer high ground, Promenades upper levels
- **Ult timing:** More aggressive early rotations okay (open terrain punishes walking)
- **Danger zones:** The Divide chokes, Stasis Net Array (third-party central)
