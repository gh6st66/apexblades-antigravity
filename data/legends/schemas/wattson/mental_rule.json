        "The best offense is an electrified defense - force enemies to come to you",
        "Early rotation wins games - be first to claim final ring position",
        "Always be fencing - even in active fights, drop quick opportunistic fences",
        "Ultimate Accelerants are your best friend - carry them religiously",
        "Don't hold ultimate too long - deploy pylon proactively when fight is expected",
        "Hide your nodes - fences behind cover are fences that work",
        "Trust your setup - enemies pushing through fences are vulnerable, not you",
        "Spread defense 360 degrees - don't overstack one entrance",
        "Information is power - fence triggers reveal enemy positions, communicate them",
        "Never wander alone - isolated Wattson is dead Wattson",
        "Practice hybrid play in pubs - quick fences during chaos, not just elaborate forts",
        "End-game is your domain - dominate final rings through superior preparation",
        "Shield sustain wins wars - positioning near pylon gives unlimited shield trading",
        "Second pylon destroys first - only redeploy strategically",
        "Buildings are your kingdom - interior defense is where Wattson excels"
