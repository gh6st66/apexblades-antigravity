# MAP OVERLAY — OLYMPUS (S27 Amped)

**Season:** S27 Amped  
**Mode:** BR Ranked  
**Rework Status:** Major POI and rotation rework with added cover

---

## GLOBAL ADJUSTMENTS

### Ring Behavior
- **Ring 1-2:** Often pulls toward Gardens/Estates side; Energy Depot is common early zone
- **Ring 3-4:** Hammond Labs or Oasis areas frequently become contested
- **Ring 5+:** Final rings favor buildings with height (Estates, Gardens hillside, Hammond)

### Third-Party Hotspots
- **Estates:** Central courtyard is a kill box; 3+ squads common
- **Hammond Labs:** Multiple entrances, audio is chaos, third parties from every angle
- **Turbine:** Wide open; fights attract squads from Energy Depot AND Gardens

### Safe Rotation Paths
- Phase Runner → Gardens (early, low traffic if ring pulls opposite)
- Oasis back side → Energy Depot edge (avoids Turbine exposure)
- Rift → Estates (use buildings for cover, not open courtyard)

### Dead Zones (Avoid)
- **Turbine center:** No cover, sniper food
- **Solar Array:** Isolated, long rotations if ring pulls away
- **Fight Night interior:** Abilities disabled, unpredictable chaos

## POI-SPECIFIC OVERRIDES

### Estates
| Legend Type | Adjustment |
|-------------|------------|
| Macro (Valk, Path) | Use ult to escape courtyard third-parties, not to push in |
| Anchor (Rampart, Wattson) | Control rooftop buildings, walls on stairs |
| Entry (Rev, Octane) | Dive isolated players on balconies, avoid courtyard |
| Flex (Horizon, Wraith) | Lift to rooftops, portal for team extraction |

**Height control:** Rooftops are king; courtyard is death  
**Ult timing:** Save for escape or roof-to-roof repositions  
**Danger zones:** Central courtyard, main entrances

---

### Hammond Labs
| Legend Type | Adjustment |
|-------------|------------|
| Macro (Valk, Path) | Exit via zipline or ult when third-partied |
| Anchor (Rampart, Wattson) | Hold main room chokes, walls on doorways |
| Entry (Rev, Octane) | Clear rooms fast, don't linger in main area |
| Flex (Horizon, Wraith) | Black Hole in main room, lift through skylights |

**Height control:** Upper catwalks provide angles, but exposed to multiple doors  
**Ult timing:** Rampart Sheila dominates main room; Horizon ult in chokes  
**Danger zones:** Main entrance (multiple angles), back stairs (audio dead zone)

---

### Gardens
| Legend Type | Adjustment |
|-------------|------------|
| Macro (Valk, Path) | Height advantage from hillside, ult to Estates or Oasis |
| Anchor (Rampart, Wattson) | Walls in tunnel chokes, control building interiors |
| Entry (Rev, Octane) | Climb exterior walls, dive through tunnels |
| Flex (Horizon, Wraith) | Lift for hillside peeks, portal through tunnels |

**Height control:** Hillside overlooking tunnels is premium real estate  
**Ult timing:** Save for ring rotations; Gardens often isn't final zone  
**Danger zones:** Main bridge (sniper target), tunnel exits (pre-aimed)

---

### Turbine
| Legend Type | Adjustment |
|-------------|------------|
| Macro (Valk, Path) | DO NOT STAY. Rotate through, use ult immediately if caught |
| Anchor (Rampart, Wattson) | Avoid entirely — no defensible positions |
| Entry (Rev, Octane) | Sprint through, don't engage |
| Flex (Horizon, Wraith) | Lift is wasted here; portal for fast transit only |

**Height control:** None — exposed from all directions  
**Ult timing:** Use ANY mobility ult to leave, not fight  
**Danger zones:** Entire POI

## WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS

| Range | Preferred Weapons | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| Close | Alternator, Peacekeeper | Indoor POIs (Hammond, Estates buildings) |
| Mid | G7 Scout, Bocek | Poke across Estates courtyard, Gardens hillside |
| Long | Sentinel, Charge Rifle | Only viable at Turbine edges (high risk) |

---

## LEGEND TIER ADJUSTMENTS (Olympus S27)

| Tier | Legends | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| S | Valkyrie, Horizon, Rampart | Valk rotations, Horizon vertical POIs, Rampart indoor holds |
| A | Wraith, Pathfinder, Bangalore | Portals/zips for extraction, smoke for open rotations |
| B | Revenant, Octane, Fuse | Dive works but third-parties punish hard |
| C | Gibraltar, Caustic | Dome/gas less effective in vertical indoor POIs |

## MENTAL RULE (Olympus)
